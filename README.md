# Coding Challenge: E-commerce Product Listing and Filtering Page

## Project Objective

Develop a responsive web page that displays a list of e-commerce products, with filtering and sorting functionalities.

## Context

Your task is to build the main product listing page for an online store. This page should display products attractively and allow users to easily find what they're looking for through filters and sorting.

## Essential Requirements (MVP - Minimum Viable Product)

1.  **Project Structure:**
    * If you prefer, you can use a modern frontend framework/library (e.g., React, Vue, Svelte, Angular or Next.js/Nuxt.js if preferred).
    * In this case, use TypeScript (strongly recommended).    
2.  **Product Listing:**
    * Display a list of products, each with at least: `Name`, `Image`, `Price`, `Short Description` (optional).
    * Product data can be simulated (static JSON in the frontend) or consumed from a mocked REST API (e.g., JSONPlaceholder, or create a small local Node.js server that returns static JSON).
    * Well-formatted and styled product cards.
3.  **Product Filters:**
    * Implement interactive filters by:
        * **Category:** (e.g., "Electronics", "Apparel", "Books").
        * **Price Range:** A slider or input fields to define a minimum and maximum price.
4.  **Product Sorting:**
    * Implement sorting options by:
        * Price (ascending and descending).
        * Name (A-Z and Z-A).
5.  **Responsive Design:**
    * The page must be fully responsive, ensuring a seamless user experience across desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.
    * Use media queries and/or flexible layout approaches (Flexbox/Grid).
    * "Mobile-first" design is preferred.
6.  **Styling:**
    * Write clean and organized CSS (can be CSS Modules, Styled Components, Sass/Less, or plain CSS).
    * Ensure good spacing, typography, and visual hierarchy.
7.  **Performance:**
    * Ensure the page loads quickly and is responsive to user interactions.
    * Basic image optimization (if applicable).
8.  **Version Control:**
    * Use Git for versioning the code.

## Additional Requirements (Differentiators)

These points are not mandatory for MVP completion but add significant value and demonstrate a higher level of expertise.

1.  **Product Detail Page:** Create a separate page for product details, accessible by clicking on the product card in the listing.
2.  **Basic Shopping Cart State:** A simple cart icon that shows the number of items added (does not require functional checkout, just visual state).
3.  **Performance Optimization:** Implement lazy loading for product images or pagination/infinite scroll for the listing.
4.  **Astro Framework:** Develop the project using the Astro Framework, demonstrating the use of interactive islands with React/Vue/Svelte components.
5.  **Integration with E-commerce Tools (Conceptual):**
    * Describe how you would integrate Google Tag Manager (GTM) or a Facebook Ads pixel on this page for event tracking (e.g., product view, add to cart). A full functional integration is not required, only the conceptual explanation and where the code would be placed.

## Project Submission

1.  **Git Repository:**
    * Create a public Git repository (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket).
    * Ensure the commit history is clean and reflects development progress.
2.  **README.md:** Include this detailed `README.md` file in your repository.
3.  **Deadline:** The project must be submitted within **7 calendar days** from the receipt of this challenge.

## Evaluation Criteria

* **Functionality:** How well the essential requirements are met.
* **Code Quality:** Clarity, readability, modularity, code conventions, TypeScript usage.
* **Responsive Design:** Effectiveness of implementation across different devices.
* **User Experience (UX):** Ease of use, visual feedback from interactions.
* **Performance:** Page loading and interface responsiveness.
* **Technology Usage:** Effective application of the chosen framework/library, HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
* **Problem Solving:** The overall approach to solving the presented challenges.
* **Version Control:** Quality of commit history and Git usage.
* **Documentation:** Clarity and completeness of the `README.md` file.
* **Differentiators:** Added value from implemented additional requirements.

Good luck! We look forward to seeing your solution.
